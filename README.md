### What we did in short ?
The objective of this hackathon is to predict the estimated time of arrival at the dropoff point for a single Yassir journey. Our model used more than 50 features, some of these features were created by clustering the geographical data (latitude and longitud) into 300 clusters.

At the end, we used a weighted average of fine tuned XGBoost, Catboost and a default Random Forest, the model scored around 140 seconds in local cross validation and 148.51 seconds on final leaderboard (private LB), it is great to think that our model is 2 min and 20 seconds off in average.

### What we used ?
We used several open source python packages and frameworks: Pandas, Numpy, SciKit Learn, Catboost, LightGBM, Random Forest, plotly and Matplotlib.
